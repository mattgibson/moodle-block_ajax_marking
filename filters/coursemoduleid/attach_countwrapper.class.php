/**
 * These classes provide filters that modify the dynamic query that fetches the nodes. Depending on
 * what node is being requested and what that node's ancestor nodes are, a different combination
 * of filters will be applied. There is one class per type of node, and one method with the class
 * for the type of operation. If there is a courseid node as an ancestor, we want to use the
 * courseid::where_filter, but if we are asking for courseid nodes, we want the
 * courseid::count_select filter.
